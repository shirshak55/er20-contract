# ER20 Contract

Uses Parity Substrate

For react ui visit ui dir.
For launching node go to react_node directory


It takes like 1 and half hour to compile in my machine so chill (Dual core laptop) :D

UI should run in like 5 min

After compiling using cargo build run ./target/release/binary_name --dev --tmp and try to deploy contract should be good.


Thanks
