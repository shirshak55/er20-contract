# ER20 Contract

Screenshots: https://gist.github.com/shirshak55/ec1d53b7d583e51dec816b6b21fc8ba0

Uses Parity Substrate

For react ui visit ui dir.
For launching node go to react_node directory


It takes like 1 and half hour to compile in my machine so chill (Dual core laptop) :D

UI should run in like 5 min

After compiling using cargo build run ./target/release/binary_name --dev --tmp and try to deploy contract should be good.


Thanks
